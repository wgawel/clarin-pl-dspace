		<br/>
		<p>
			The ultimate objective of CLARIN ERIC is to advance research in humanities and social sciences by giving researchers unified single sign-on access to a platform which integrates language-based resources and advanced tools at a European level. This shall be implemented by the construction and operation of a shared distributed infrastructure that aims at making language resources, technology and expertise available to the humanities and social sciences (henceforth abbreviated HSS) research communities at large.

		<h3 id="terms-of-service">Terms of Service</h3>
		<p>
        To achieve our mission statement,we set out some ground rules through the <a href="./terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>. By accessing or using any kind of data or services provided by the Repository, you agree to abide by the Terms contained in the above mentioned document.
        </p>
        <p>
        Data in CLARIN-PL repository are made available under the licence attached to the resources. In case there is no licence, data is made freely available for access, printing and download for the purposes of non-commercial research or private study.

        Users <strong>must</strong> acknowledge in any publication, the Deposited Work using a persistent identifier (see <a href="#citing-data">Citing Data</a>), its original author(s)/creator(s), and any publisher where applicable. Full items must not be harvested by robots except transiently for full-text indexing or citation analysis. Full items must not be sold commercially unless explicitaly granted by the attached licence without formal permission of the copyright holders.

		<h3 id="about-repository">About Repository</h3>
		<p>It is like a library for linguistic data and tools.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Search for data and tools and easily download them.</li>
			<li>Deposit the data and be sure it is safely stored, everyone
				can find it, use it, and correctly cite it (giving you credit)</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<br/>	
	<div>
		<h3 id="about-contracts">License Agreement and Contracts</h3>
		<p>At the moment, CLARIN-PL distinguishes three types of contracts.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>For every deposit, we enter into a standard contract with the submitter, the so-called <a id="distribution-link" href="contract">"Deposition License Agreement"</a>, in which we describe our rights and duties and the submitter acknowledges that they have the right to submit the data and gives us (the repository centre) right to distribute the data on their behalf.</li>
			<li>Everyone who downloads data is bound by the licence assigned to the item - in order to download protected data, one has to be authenticated and needs to electronically sign the licence. A list of available licenses in our repository can be found <a href="licenses" id="available-licenses">here.</a></li>
			<li>For submitters, there is a possibility for setting custom licences to items during the submission workflow.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<br/>
	<div>
		<h3 id="about-ipr">Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
		<p>
As mentioned in the section <a href="#about-contracts">License Agreement and Contracts</a>, we require the depositor of data or tools to sign a Distribution License Agreement, which specifies that they have the right to submit the data and gives us (the repository centre) right to distribute the data on their behalf. This means that depositors are solely responsible for taking care of IPR issues before publishing data or tools by submitting them to us.
<br/>
Should anyone have a suspicion that any of the datasets or tools in our repository violate Intellectual Property Rights, they should contact us immediately at our help desk.

		<h3 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h3>
		<p>Read our <a href="https://clarin-pl.eu/en/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a> in order to learn how we manage personal data collected by the CLARIN-PL repository and services.

    <div>
		<h3 id="metadata-policy">Metadata Policy</h3>
		<p>
       Deposited content must be accompanied by <a href="metadata">sufficient metadata</a> describing its content, provenance and formats in order to support its preservation and dissemination. Metadata are freely accessible and are distributed in the public domain (under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0</a>). However, we reserve the right to be informed about commercial usage of metadata from CLARIN-PL repository including a description of your use case at <a class="helpdesk-tolink" href="#">Help Desk</a>.
        </p>
	</div>
	<br/>

    <div>
		<h3 id="preservation-policy">Preservation Policy</h3>
		<p>
        CLARIN-PL is committed to the long-term care of items deposited in our repository and strives to adopt the current best practice in digital preservation.
        </p>
		<p>
			To ensure the integrity of the data sets, for every deposited file a checksum (md5 type) is made which
			allows us to check for defects of the data over the years.
			Once deposited, files in data sets are never changed and only minor changes to the metadata are
			allowed. For example: correction of spelling, minor changes in documentation, additional documentation
			added. Changes to the data themselves will be issued as a new version of the dataset, which will obtain a
			new persistent identifier. These changes are only made in close collaboration with the producer of the
			dataset.
		</p>
	</div>
	<br/>
	<div>
		<h3 id="authenticity-policy">Authenticity Policy</h3>
		<p>
			Data producers hand over the materials to us. We do not change the data, except by adding metadata if
			required.
			If applicable, we create collection-level objects which provide a context for the embedded data sets.
			The repository maintains links to other relevant materials (e.g. articles, theses, documentation, related
			data) and to software and tools that have been used in production of the data, if applicable.
			The identity of a depositor is ensured by the required login using CLARIN SpF for identification.
